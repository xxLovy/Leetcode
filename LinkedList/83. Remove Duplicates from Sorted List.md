[83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-list/)

Use fast and slow pointer to solve. If the value of fast pointer equals to the value of the slow pointer, fast pointer will keep going forward. The other situation, the value of the fast pointer is a new value which should be in the final linkedlist so the slow pointer will go forward and overwrite the original value with the value in fast pointer.

```py
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def deleteDuplicates(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        if not head or not head.next:
            return head
        p = head
        q = head.next
        while q:
            if p.val != q.val:
                p = p.next
                p.val = q.val
            q = q.next
        p.next = None
        return head
```
