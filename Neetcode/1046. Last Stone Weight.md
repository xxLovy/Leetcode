[1046. Last Stone Weight](https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight/)

Heap

A little trick: heapq only can build min heap but we can use a minus sign to make it a max heap

```py
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeight(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        heap = []
        for n in stones:
            heapq.heappush(heap, -n)
        while len(heap) > 1:
            y = -heapq.heappop(heap)
            x = -heapq.heappop(heap)
            if x != y:
                heapq.heappush(heap, x-y)

        return 0 if len(heap)==0 else -heap[0]

```
